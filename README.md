#MyGigScene Booking App

## Submission for the CodeInstitute Full Stack Software Development Bootcamp Data Centric Milestone Project


For an introduction to the idea behind this project and what I was trying to achieve please review the pdf [Data Centric Milestone Project Design Doc](..design_docs/Data Centric Milestone Project Design Doc.pdf)

###Submission Summary

I decided on this subject for my project as it relates to the business idea I have.

Unfortunately I underestimated the amount of work that was going to be required to implement this solution and the number of pages that would be required to make everything work.  The time for this project was limited and this was compounded by me having to move house in the middle of the time allocated for the project and I was not able to use the internet at home for most of the period.

Therefore there is a lot of functionality within this site which is still not working and there are a lot of styling elements that I would have liked to have gotten right before submission.

####Elements that are working;

The Mongo database is connected 
The Venues and Artists pages are pulling the dynamic content in.
The Add New Venue and Artist forms have been created and are working
The Edit Artist form is partially completed - I couldn't get  the Price Range and Genre dropdowns to work before submission.
Add Gig form created but requires additional development 

####Features not completed;

Filters for the views
Delete function needs to be added to the delete buttons on the venue and artist cards
Gig Listing Page is not functional and has minimal layout applied to show concept
There should be add Town and add Genre buttons and functions on the Add New Venue page
There should be an add new Genre button on the Add New Artist page


###Technology Used

*MongoDb
*Python3
*jQuery
*Flask
*Jinja
*Materialize CSS
*Bootstrap CSS
*Custom HTML & CSS

###Testing

Elements were tested as they were developed but as the functionality could not be completed in the time alloted there was no formal testing done for the functionality across the application.

###Deployment

The application has been deployed using Heroku and can be launched using this link [MyGigScene](https://mygigscene-booking-app.herokuapp.com)
